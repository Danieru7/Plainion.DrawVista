# Next

- apply DIP
- apply ISP to have all IO in one class (DrawIoReader, SvgStore)

- provide asp.net with minimal API
  - single file can be uploaded & gets processed
  - LiteDB as storage?
- also needs to deliver WebUI of course

- support for individual PNG which drawio models
  - then by definition many files need to be uploaded
  - we should maybe consider "projects" for which files could be uploaded
  - then the file name could be the page name or the page name is given on the UI
